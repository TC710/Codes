This is the final project for my CS355 course in Fall 2020.

First time learning Javascript
The code is messy but readable.
To get the code working just need to fill out the auth/credentials.json
    Visit https://getpocket.com/developer/ to get the authentication and create a getpocket account for you to login when running the code
